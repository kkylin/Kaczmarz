module BlockToeplitz

import Base:getindex,setindex!,view

## If we don't mind allocating lots, e.g., view() returns a
## new vector or matrix every time, then we only need to
## extend view() for REK.jl to work.  OTOH if we want to be
## more efficient, then we'll also need to define getindex()
## and setindex!() for View objects.
